> **🤖 FOR AI AGENTS & LLMs:** Before analyzing or modifying this repository, you **MUST** read [agent.md](file:///agent.md) for behavioral rules and [memory.md](file:///memory.md) for strict architectural context. Do not proceed without reading them.
**PharmaNear** is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between users searching for specific medicines and nearby pharmacies that stock them. It offers an intuitive search experience for users and a secure admin dashboard for pharmacy owners to manage inventory and profile details efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) *(New? Watch a [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIJeLiaGfA0))*
- **MongoDB** (Optional) - The app uses an in-memory DB locally, but you can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) for production/cloud setups.
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Foces-core/pharmanear.git
cd pharmanear
```

### 2. Installation & Zero-Config Setup

PharmaNear features a **zero-config local development environment**. If you don't provide a MongoDB connection string, the backend will automatically spin up an in-memory database (`mongodb-memory-server`) for instant testing!

Install all dependencies using the root setup script:
```bash
pnpm install:all
```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL for pnpm v10+ users:** Newer versions of `pnpm` block package build scripts for security. You **must** approve them for the database and frontend to build:
> 1. Run `pnpm approve-builds` in the `frontend` folder (Press `a` then `Enter`).
> 2. Run `pnpm approve-builds` in the `backend` folder (Press `a` then `Enter`).

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional for Local Dev)

If you want to connect to a real MongoDB Atlas database, create `.env` files in the `frontend/` and `backend/` directories based on the `.env.example` templates. 

Otherwise, just skip this step—the app works completely out of the box!

### 4. Backend Setup
in a diff terminal 
```bash
cd backend
pnpm start
```
The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 5. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```
The frontend will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 5. Access the Application
- Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
- For pharmacy admin features, sign up or log in as a pharmacy owner.

## 📖 Usage & Local Testing

### 1. Data Seeding (Where does the data come from?)
For a smooth developer experience, the app automatically handles data seeding on startup:
- **Medicines:** If the database has 0 medicines, the server automatically downloads thousands of real-world US drugs from the **NIH RxTerms API** into your MongoDB database.
- **Local Pharmacies:** If you run locally without a `MONGO_URL`, the server will auto-generate fake pharmacies and attach random stock to them.
- **Production Pharmacies:** If you deploy to production with an empty pharmacy database, the server will inject 3 fake pharmacies and stock them with common medicines like "Acetaminophen" and "Ibuprofen" so the live map isn't completely empty.

### 1. Creating a Pharmacy (Admin Setup)
To test the admin features locally or on the live site:
1. Navigate to the **Sign Up** page.
2. Enter your pharmacy's details (Name, Owner, City, Phone) and create a secure password.
3. Click **Sign Up**. You will be automatically logged into the Pharmacy Dashboard.
4. From the dashboard, you can click **Add Medicine** to start building your inventory.

### 2. User Search Testing
1. Enter a medicine name on the Home page (e.g., a medicine you just added to your pharmacy).
2. Click **Search Nearby**. The app will map pharmacies holding that stock.

### 3. Map Interaction
Click on map markers to view pharmacy details, including contact info, opening hours, and stock status.

## 🌍 Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `backend` and `frontend` using these keys:

### `backend/.env`
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | The port the Node.js server runs on (Default: 5000) |
| `MONGO_URL` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A secure, random string for signing authentication tokens |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | The URL allowed to make API requests (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` or `*`) |

### `frontend/.env`
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL` | The URL of your live backend API. If blank, it defaults to `http://localhost:5000` |

## 🛠️ Common Troubleshooting

- **❌ MongoDB Connection Error (`querySrv ECONNREFUSED _mongodb._tcp...`):** 
  - **On Render:** Your MongoDB Atlas cluster is blocking Render's IP. Go to MongoDB Atlas -> Security -> Network Access and add `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access From Anywhere).
  - **Local Machine:** Your ISP or router is blocking the special `mongodb+srv` connection string. Here are 3 ways to bypass this backend error:
    1. **Zero-Config Bypass (Easiest):** Open `backend/.env` and leave `MONGO_URL` completely blank (`MONGO_URL=`). The server will automatically use the local in-memory database instead!
    2. **Get Legacy String:** If you *must* connect to Atlas locally, get the older connection string format. Go to your Atlas Dashboard -> Connect -> Drivers -> Select Node.js **Version 2.2.12**. Copy the long string starting with `mongodb://`.
    3. **Change DNS:** Change your computer's DNS to `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).
- **❌ Frontend Build Fails Locally:**
  - Make sure you approve Vite/esbuild to run by executing `pnpm approve-builds` in the frontend directory.

## 🔌 Core API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/pharmacy/signup` - Register a new pharmacy
- `POST /api/pharmacy/login` - Authenticate and receive a JWT

### Health Monitoring
- `GET /api/health` - Returns server health information including status, uptime, and timestamp.

### Medicines & Stock
- `GET /api/drugs?name=X` - Search for a medicine and see all pharmacies stocking it
- `POST /api/pharmacy/stock` - Add or update stock for a specific medicine
- `GET /api/pharmacy/stock?pharmacy_id=X` - View all stock for a pharmacy
- `PATCH /api/pharmacy/stock` - Modify stock quantities or pricing
- `DELETE /api/pharmacy/stock` - Remove a medicine from inventory
